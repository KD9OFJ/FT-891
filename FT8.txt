Here are my (KD9OFJ) FT-891 Settings for 'Mobile Operating' FT8

17-01 RESET FACTORY		Start here, clean slate, Yaesu Defaults. Latest firmware! At the time of this writing: 
18-01 MAIN VERSION: V01-09
18-01 DSP VERSION: V02-04
18-01 LCD VERSION: V01-01

Personal UI Preferences:

02-03 DIMMER LCD: 2		Keep it low. Save your night vision. Also saves power.
02-04 DIMMER TX/BUSY: 2		See above.
02-05 PEAK HOLD: 2.0sec		Good for figuring out the 'max' of a fast changing SWR/PO meter. 
05-04 BEEP LEVEL: 0		My first instinct is to want to smash any technology that beeps at me.

DIGITAL MODES: (WSJT-X FT8 etc...)

01-02 AGC MID DELAY: 500msec    This is the gain setting that AGC AUTO will use when doing DATA mode.
				This change is slightly lower than the default of 700msec, which is for PSK. 
				(Remember the FT-891 predates FT8.) 
				SOURCE: The most recent firmware for the Yaesu FTDX10 includes a special 'PRESET' mode for FT8
				and when that PRESET is enabled this is what that setting us. 							

05-06 CAT RATE: 38400bps	All the bps. As high as it can go is best. 
05-07 CAT TOT: 1000ms		The default timeout value of 10ms is too short. Try 1000ms for DigiRig. 

05-20 FAN CONTROL: CONTEST	FT8 like most data modes is a 100% duty cycle mode and things will get hot. Save your finals!

08-01 DATA MODE: OTHERS		The FT-891 predates modern modes like FT8 and its digital mode defaults are set for PSK.  
08-03 OTHER DISP: 1500Hz	These settings are required to make it work with modern modes.
08-04 OTHER SHIFT: 1500Hz	 

FUNCTION-1:
WDH: 3000			It will default to 500Hz in DATA mode because that's PSK. Need 3000Hz for most digital modes in WSJT-X. 
				Might want to assign this to one of the A/B/C front buttons since it seems to turn off/change inconvienently? 

08-05 DATA LCUT FREQ: 100Hz     Signals below and above these frequencies will be thrown off a cliff. 
08-06 DATA LCUT SLOPE: 18dB/oct There is much carrier noise below 100Hz, get rid of it.  
08-07 DATA HCUT FREQ: 3000Hz	Although the WSJT-X software can deal with it, it would be better if not there in the first place. 
08-09 DATA LCUT SLOPE: 18dB/oct This way more of the CPU power is dedicated to decoding legit signals instead of noise. I have waterfall OCD.
08-10 DATA PTT SELECT: DAKY	PTT is sent via serial TX line as a command. RTS and DTR do work as well since it's a full USB-B serial port.
				I have had issues with DAKY PTT not working right and that might be related to CAT TOT being too low...YMMV.
08-12 DATA BFO: USB		Most data modes are Upper Side Band regardless of the frequency.

11-03 SSB TX BPF: 300-2700	Change this to 300-2700 for SSB Phone DX/QRP or 200-2800 for SSB Phone QRO RagChew
				Note that the FT-891 does not have a TX band pass filter for DATA modes, only SSB. 

16-14 DATA DATA GAIN: 50  	This will vary with whatever little box is used to interface the computer with the radio
				and is used in conjuction with the computer volume to make sure that the the audio is not
				being overdriven eg 'shouting into the microphone.' ALC is the meter that moves when this
				is happening. Leave this at the default and adjust computer volume, starting from low
				(10%) and move up until the ALC meter moves. Temporarily turn off 02-05 PEAK HOLD for this.
				
				Ideally you want to find a combination of settings so that the WSJT-X Pwr slider works 
				somewhat accurately. Eg, set to -10.0db makes your 100W -> 10W. This way you can vary your
				power output without having to find the radio and dig through radio menus. 

				For example, you can set Pwr to -13.0db to make a 100W radio do 5W. 
				RX can't hear your QRP QSO? Punch up the Pwr slider a bit, no radio visit required.
				
				Wanna do some WSPR? Set it about half way to -20.0db.
