Here are my (KD9OFJ) FT-891 Settings for 'Mobile Operating' SSB Phone 

SSB PHONE OPTIMIZATIONS from HL1ZIX:
			
Philosophy: Most radios do not have good sounding RX bass from their tiny internal/microphone speakers.
Therefore when TXing, it makes sense to attenuate your voice lows and boost the highs so that you sound better on RX from crap speakers.
(Unless the operator has paid an arm and a leg, firstborn, 401K and mortgage for the 'big external speaker.')

VOICE MODES (Equalizer settings when compression aka processing aka 'PRC' is _OFF_):
15-01 EQ1 FREQ: 300  		Lows: At frequencies +- 8 around 300hz, reduce gain by 15.
